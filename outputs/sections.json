We're mainly going to be covering the Git tooling as it pertains to working with Git inside of VS Code but we are going to cover some GitHub specific features like how to push a branch to GitHub, how to clone things like that. So I'd recommend you have all of these set up and if you need any help with that I have videos for every single one of these topics which I'll link down in the description below. All right so with all that out of the way let's go ahead and start working with Git inside of Visual Studio Code. So the first thing I'm going to do is go ahead and open up a terminal and what we're going to do is create a folder for our project. So when working with Visual Studio Code and with Git your projects are literally just folders. It's a collection of files and folders and Visual Studio Code can open these and you can work with those files inside of those folders and then Git basically initializes a repository inside of that folder and keeps track of those changes inside of a special folder called .git. So it's a little bit out of scope of this course but just want to let you know what's going on behind the scenes and at the end of the day it's literally just a",

I can publish my branch if I'm connected to github and then down here in the bottom left hand corner you can see that our repository has been initialized with a default branch called main and we are ready to start working with git source control inside of vscode. So clicking that button to initialize the repository is the equivalent of running the git init command inside of the command line and what I'm gonna actually go ahead and do for the remainder of this video is open up the terminal so I can click on the terminal window up here at the top and click new terminal. I can also press control tilde to toggle my terminal open and closed but basically what we just did is the equivalent of running git init which will initialize a brand new repository.
